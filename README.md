# American-Politics-Seminar-Project

This was my semester project for American Politics Seminar in the Spring of 2025. I was exploring the various forms of direct democracy in the state-level governments of the fifty US states, and examining what kinds of states were associated with increased or decreased direct democratic participation at the state level. To do this, I compiled data about the laws states have concerning judicial elections, ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments, and recall elections. I classified the systems in place, and then constructed an index which combined these four criteria into one number from 0 to 1. I created maps to help visualize these metrics, and measured how well each of them predicted the other hypothetically correlated political variables. 

## Deliverable

The deliverable for this project was the final report, _AmerPol Project-Final Submission_.

## Documents

 _AmerPol Project.Rmd_ is the document on which all of my work for this project was completed.
 
_Apol_Data.csv_ contains the data I gathered for this project, imported from a Google Sheets document I made. 

I made _PrezMap_Interactive.html_ to explore options to use maps to visualize my data. I had not finished collecting my actual data for this project, so I decided to map presidential election data. The map shows the number of elections won by each party from 1900-2024. The data for this HTML is contained in _PrezWinner_1900-2024.csv_. This does not have any other bearing on the project, and does not feature in the deliverable. 

## Packages
This project was completed in RStudio, using packages _tidyverse_ and _plotly_. The final report was written in Google Docs.

## AI and Reproduction

This report was written independently and without the assistance of generative AI.
